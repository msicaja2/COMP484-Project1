                    Hello and welcome! I've dedicated this website to my favorite type of animal, sharks! Sharks are
                    some of the most misunderstood animals, especially in pop culture. With films like Jaws and other
                    flicks demonizing sharks, it's easy to forget that they are just animals, not monsters. Due to this
                    perception of sharks, it makes people unaware of their importance to the marine ecosystem, and has
                    led to the overfishing of these amazing creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, shark conservation isn't the main point of this website (if you want to learn more about shark
                    conservation, please take a look at the organization at the bottom of the pages on this site). The point
                    of this website is to show how truly unique these animals can be. They come in many shapes and sizes. I
                    also wish to show why these are my favorite animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will not focus on the scariest or dangerous sharks, but more on the weirdest and unique sharks that
                    have and still roam the blue depths of the ocean. To show you what I mean, you would typically rank sharks
                    by their danger in an order like this (again, they are just animals, but animals can still be dangerous):
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bull Shark</li>
                    <li>Tiger Shark</li>
                    <li>Great White Shark</li>
                </ol>
                <p>...and so on, but even the most dangerous of the three sharks would rank at the highest like this:</p>
                <!-- the start attribute: this sets the starting integer for an ordered list (ol). It always displays an
                     arabic numeral even if the TYPE is set to roman numerals. Here, it is used to start our ordered list
                     at 50, as a way to show that the sharks presented on this website are not dangerous to people
                -->
                <ol start="50">
                    <li>Greenland Shark</li>
                    <li>Thresher Shark</li>
                </ol>
                <p>...and again so on (just as a side note, this ranking isn't from any official source, it is just an
                    example I came up with). So with that out of the way, I welcome you to learn about the three spotlight
                    sharks of this website:
