                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/thresher_shark.jpg" alt="Thresher Shark" class="imageFlowRight">
                    There are three known species of Thresher Sharks: the pelagic, big-eyed, and common thresher shark. These
                    creatures can be easily recognized by their large, long tail, which can be as big, or even bigger than their
                    actual body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their tail doesn't just show off their strangeness or uniqueness; it actually serves a purpose.
                    Thresher Sharks will propel themselves forward toward a group of fish or other prey and whip their tail in
                    an attempt to stun the fish, making it easier for them to eat. Although this tail seems like it would be dangerous
                    to humans, threshers will actually do their best to avoid humans and will typically stay towards the bottom
                    of the seabed. They are almost physically incapable of biting people because of the size of their mouths and
                    their small teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Threshers are endothermic, meaning that they can maintain their own body heat despite the coldness of the
                    outside environment. This is what allows them to live in pretty much all temperatures of water around the
                    world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These sharks are also ovoviviparous, meaning females will keep their eggs inside their bodies, where the eggs
                    will receive nutrients from a yolk sac. Then, when they are ready, they will give birth to live pups, which is not
                    typical of other types of fish and is only really seen in certain species of sharks.
                </p>
